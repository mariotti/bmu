BackMeUp - A tool to make backups for personal use and maybe system wide too

I will populate the repository asap.

The basic idea comes from https://blog.techottis.ch/2016/10/15/backup-with-rsync-a-la-time-machine-a-proof/.

The initial implemetation is here: https://github.com/mariotti/mfsh-scripts/blob/master/bin/backmeup.sh

I have a better code on my machine but needs some cleanup. I just wanted to reserve the BMU name ;)

Coming back soon

Firsts scripts are there..
..mm.. docs asap too.
